# Project Introduction: Customer Segmentation with RFM Analysis
## __Objective:__
The main objective is to analyze customer behavior using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model. By leveraging RFM analysis, we aim to gain insights into customer segments based on their transaction history.

## __Tools and Technologies:__
The project is implemented using Python, and various data analysis libraries such as Pandas and NumPy. Visualization is achieved through Matplotlib, Plotly and Seaborn. The choice of these tools aligns with the coursework's emphasis on practical applications.
